The following are non-authoritative answers, means these query replies
are sent by the authoritative DNS indirectly i.e. forwarded through
the local DNS server 127.0.0.53

ISP 1:
Local DNS server: 127.0.0.53
google: 172.217.19.132
facebook: 31.13.79.35

Public DNS server(Google): 8.8.8.8
google: 142.250.77.68
facebook: 157.240.16.35

Public DNS server(Cloudfare): 1.1.1.1
google: 142.250.192.132
facebook: 157.240.7.35

ISP 2: 
Local DNS server 2: 127.0.0.53
googl: 142.250.193.4
facebook: 157.240.16.35

Public DNS server(Google): 8.8.8.8
google: 142.251.42.36
facebook: 31.13.79.35

Public DNS server(Cloudfare): 1.1.1.1
google: 142.250.76.196
facebook: 31.13.79.35

Observation: Different DNS servers give different IP addresses for 
the same website, which might have to do with the fact that DNS 
servers use different servers of the same web site,and the 
existence of multiple servers for the same website is expected from
a site like google which receives heavy traffic. The same reason 
can be applied to explain the observation that even the same DNS 
server on different access networks can return different IPs for
the same website.
